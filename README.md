# Lorekeeper

Lorekeeper is a framework for managing deviantART-based ARPGs/closed species masterlists coded using the Laravel framework. In simple terms - you will be able to make a copy of the site, do some minor setup/enter data about your species and game, and it'll provide you with the automation to keep track of your species, players and ARPG submissions.

This repo is made to archive extensions of mine/their branches which have since been integrated into [modified-main](https://github.com/corowne/lorekeeper/tree/modified-main). This is in the interests of cleaning up my fork and making it clear that the branches there are not in active use, but still retaining access to the code itself.

It stands to mention that the branches here will not be updated; support for them is continued in modified-main only.
